<h2>How to get xen-tools run</h2>

<strong>xen-tools</strong> is a convenient tool for creating xen guests. If you use all xen 
related packages from your distro's official repo, probably you won't get into 
any trouble.  </p>

<p><strong>But</strong>, chances are that you want to build a specific version of xen. Then 
xen-tools may not work for you as expected. Here are some troubles I myself 
ran into and how I solved them.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Version numbers of xen and xen-tools must match. You can't use xen-tools 
4.4 on xen 4.5 since the interface may change with the development progress. 
I guess the extra version number doesn't matter. I ran xen-tools 4.5 on xen 
4.5.1 smoothly.  </li>
<li>Even if you've installed the proper version of xen-tools, you may still 
get an error like "ERROR:  Can't find version 4.5 of xen utils, bailing out!" 
That's because xen-tools can't find the directory of your xen files. In my 
debian jessie system, the message was produce by a bash script: 
"/usr/lib/xen-common/bin/xen-dir" 
It searches /usr/lib/xen-x.x for xen files. If you used the default configure 
when compiling xen, the script would probably put everything into "/usr/local" 
So, the simple solution is: delete everything in "xen-dir" script and put only 
one line of code there: "echo /usr/local". If you don't like the dirty way, 
you may google "compile xen from source" and change the configuration 
following those instrucitons.   </li>
<li>If you still get a stupid error like "ERROR:  Toolstack not specifed and 
nothing detected, bailing out!", that's because a script is trying to search 
for xl in "bin" directory, which is actually located in "sbin" in some distros. 
The specific script is "/usr/lib/xen-common/bin/xen-toolstack". 
You know how to fix it.
